# App Cleanup Summary - Play Store Preparation

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Remove unnecessary dependencies and prepare app for Play Store submission

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed PerimeterX SDK

**Why**: Unnecessary security/fraud prevention SDK for an offline card game

**Files Modified**:
- `app/build.gradle` - Removed PerimeterX dependency
- `CribbageApplication.kt` - Simplified to basic Application class
- `proguard-rules.pro` - Removed PerimeterX-specific rules

**Impact**:
- App size reduced: 13MB → 12MB (1MB savings)
- Eliminated external data collection
- Simplified privacy policy
- Faster approval process expected

### 2. ✅ Removed Network Dependencies

**Why**: No network functionality needed for offline game

**Files Modified**:
- `app/build.gradle` - Removed Retrofit, OkHttp, and Gson dependencies
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Removed INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions
- `proguard-rules.pro` - Removed network-related ProGuard rules

**Files Deleted**:
- `LoginService.kt` - Unused Retrofit interface
- `ScheduleService.kt` - Unused Retrofit interface
- `UserAgentInterceptor.kt` - Unused OkHttp interceptor

**Impact**:
- Cleaner codebase
- No unnecessary permissions requested
- Smaller attack surface
- Better privacy

### 3. ✅ Removed Debug Logging

**Why**: Production code should not contain debug logging

**Files Modified**:
- `MainActivity.kt` - Removed 4 Log.i() statements
- `CribbageMainScreen.kt` - Removed 24 Log.i() statements, 1 Log.e() statement
- `CribbageApplication.kt` - Removed all logging (already done with PerimeterX removal)

**Impact**:
- No information leakage in production
- Cleaner code
- Minor performance improvement

### 4. ✅ Updated Privacy Policy

**Why**: Reflect actual data collection practices

**Files Modified**:
- `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` - Removed PerimeterX references, simplified to offline-only
- `docs/privacy-policy.md` - Updated copy for GitHub Pages

**Key Changes**:
- Removed third-party SDK disclosure
- Updated to reflect no data collection
- Simplified network access statement
- Clarified fully offline operation

**New Privacy Statement**:
```
The Application does not collect, transmit, or store any
personally identifiable information. The Application is a
fully offline game that operates entirely on your device.
```

## Build Verification

### Release Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output**:
- Build time: 4m 19s
- APK size: 12MB (down from 13MB)
- Location: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- ProGuard/R8: ✅ Enabled and working
- Resource shrinking: ✅ Enabled and working
- Signing: ✅ Configured (requires keystore setup)

---

## Current App Status

### ✅ Compliant
- Privacy policy created and simplified
- No unnecessary permissions
- No third-party data collection
- Debug logging removed
- Code optimization enabled
- Proper versioning (1.0.0)

### ⚠️ Remaining Tasks for Play Store
1. **Host privacy policy** on GitHub Pages
2. **Create app assets**:
   - 512x512 app icon (high-res PNG)
   - 1024x500 feature graphic
   - Minimum 2 screenshots
3. **Complete Play Console setup**:
   - Store listing
   - Content rating
   - Data safety (simplified - no data collection)
4. **Create keystore** (if not done)
5. **Build and test release APK/AAB**

---

## Data Safety Declaration (for Play Store)

**Does your app collect or share user data?**
Answer: **NO**

Since we removed PerimeterX and network functionality:
- No data collected
- No data transmitted
- No third-party services
- Fully offline operation

This is the simplest and best data safety declaration possible.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Commit these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove PerimeterX SDK, cleanup code for Play Store submission

   - Removed PerimeterX SDK and network dependencies
   - Removed INTERNET permissions (app is fully offline)
   - Removed debug logging from production code
   - Simplified privacy policy (no data collection)

## Testing Recommendations

Before submitting to Play Store, test the following:

1. **Install release APK on device**:
   ```bash
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

2. **Verify functionality**:
   - [ ] App launches successfully
   - [ ] All game features work
   - [ ] Statistics save/load correctly
   - [ ] No crashes or errors
   - [ ] No network permission warnings

3. **Check ProGuard effects**:
