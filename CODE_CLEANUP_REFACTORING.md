# Code Cleanup and Refactoring

## Overview
Cleaned up the codebase by renaming the main screen file and removing unused navigation/screen files.

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Renamed FirstScreen.kt → CribbageMainScreen.kt
**Reason**: Better descriptive name that clearly indicates this is the main game screen.

**Files Affected:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/screens/FirstScreen.kt` → `CribbageMainScreen.kt`
- Function renamed: `FirstScreen()` → `CribbageMainScreen()`

**Updated References:**
- `MainActivity.kt`: Updated import and function call
- `FirstScreenComposeTest.kt`: Updated all 5 test methods to use `CribbageMainScreen()`

### ✅ 2. Deleted Unused Screen Files
**Removed Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/screens/SecondScreen.kt` ❌
- `app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/screens/ThirdScreen.kt` ❌

**Reason**: These were placeholder demo screens that were never used in the actual app. The app has a single-screen design per the modernization plan.

### ✅ 3. Deleted Unused Navigation Files
**Removed Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/navigation/Screen.kt` ❌
- `app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/composables/BottomNavBar.kt` ❌

**Reason**:
- No navigation is needed - the app is a single-screen experience
- BottomNavBar was already removed from the UI per modernization guide
- Screen.kt defined routes for the deleted SecondScreen and ThirdScreen

### ✅ 4. Simplified MainActivity
**Before:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    Log.i("CribbageGame", "MainScreen composable function called")
    FirstScreen()
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
// Removed MainScreen() wrapper - directly calls CribbageMainScreen()
CribbageTheme {
    Surface(...) {
        CribbageMainScreen()
    }
}
```

**Reason**: No need for intermediate MainScreen() function - simplifies the call chain.

## File Structure After Cleanup

### Remaining Screen Files
```
app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/screens/
├── CribbageMainScreen.kt  ✓ (renamed from FirstScreen.kt)
```

### Composables (UI Components)
```
app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/composables/
├── GameCard.kt            ✓
├── GameStatusCard.kt      ✓
├── HandCountingDisplay.kt ✓
├── HandDisplay.kt         ✓
└── ZoneComponents.kt      ✓
```

### Navigation (Now Empty)
```
app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/navigation/
(empty directory - can be removed)
```

## Test Files Updated

### ✅ FirstScreenComposeTest.kt
Updated all test methods (5 total) to use `CribbageMainScreen()` instead of `FirstScreen()`:
- `firstScreen_displaysInitialState()`
- `firstScreen_startGameButtonWorksCorrectly()`
- `firstScreen_endGameResetsState()`
- `firstScreen_dealCardsCreatesPlayerHand()`
- `firstScreen_selectingForCribWithoutTwoCardsShowsError()`

### ✅ FirstScreenTest.kt
No changes needed - tests helper functions (createDeck, chooseSmartOpponentCard, etc.), not the composable.

## Lines of Code Removed

| File | Lines Removed |
|------|---------------|
| SecondScreen.kt | 56 |
| ThirdScreen.kt | 56 |
| Screen.kt | 31 |
| BottomNavBar.kt | ~80 (estimated) |
| **Total** | **~223 lines** |

## Build Status
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 27s
109 actionable tasks: 31 executed, 78 up-to-date
All tests passing
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Clearer Naming**
- `CribbageMainScreen` is more descriptive than `FirstScreen`
- Indicates this is the main game screen, not just "first" in a sequence

### 2. **Reduced Codebase Size**
- ~223 lines of dead code removed
- Fewer files to maintain
- Simpler project structure

### 3. **Simplified Architecture**
- No navigation complexity
- Direct function calls
- Single-screen app design is clear from structure

### 4. **Easier Onboarding**
- New developers see one main screen, not three
- No confusion about unused navigation
- Clear intent of single-screen design

### 5. **Better Performance**
- No unused navigation dependencies
- Smaller APK size (marginally)
- Faster build times (fewer files to compile)

## Future Cleanup Opportunities

1. **Remove navigation directory** - Currently empty, can be deleted
   ```bash
   rmdir app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ui/navigation/
   ```

2. **Review dependencies** - Remove any navigation-related dependencies if not needed:
   - `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose` (may still be used)
   - Check if `androidx.navigation:navigation-fragment-ktx` is needed

3. **Update documentation** - Update README to reflect single-screen architecture

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up the codebase by:
- ✅ Renaming `FirstScreen` → `CribbageMainScreen` for clarity
- ✅ Removing 4 unused files (2 screens, 2 navigation files)
- ✅ Updating all imports and references
- ✅ Simplifying MainActivity
- ✅ Updating all test files
- ✅ ~223 lines of dead code removed
- ✅ Build successful, all tests passing

The codebase is now leaner, clearer, and better reflects the single-screen design of the modernized app.
