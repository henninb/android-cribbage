# Cribbage Pegging Game Logic Analysis

**Analysis Date:** October 24, 2025
**Analyst:** Claude
**Test Results:** ✅ 744 tests passed, 0 failures

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the pegging game implementation in this Android cribbage application, I found **NO CRITICAL BUGS**. All 744 unit tests pass successfully. The implementation correctly follows official cribbage pegging rules for scoring, turn management, GO handling, and sub-round resets.

However, I identified several minor issues and opportunities for improvement detailed below.

## Cribbage Pegging Rules Verification

### Verified Rules (All Correctly Implemented)
✅ **Fifteens:** 2 points when count reaches exactly 15
✅ **Thirty-ones:** 2 points when count reaches exactly 31 (NOT 3 points - the 2 includes the GO point)
✅ **Pairs:** 2 points for pair, 6 for triple, 12 for quad (only at tail of pile)
✅ **Runs:** Points equal to run length (minimum 3 cards)
✅ **Run Order:** Runs do not need to be played in sequential order (e.g., 5-3-4 is a valid run)
✅ **Duplicate Breaking:** Duplicate ranks in the trailing window break pegging runs
✅ **No Double Runs:** Unlike hand scoring, pegging does not score multiple runs for duplicates
✅ **GO Points:** 1 point for last card when both players cannot play (separate from 31)
✅ **Count Limit:** Maximum count of 31 before reset
✅ **Turn Switching:** Turn alternates after each play; after reset, opposite player starts

## Issues Found

### 1. Documentation Issue (Minor)
**File:** `Pegging31ScoringTest.kt:61-81`
**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Misleading comment

**Issue:**
```kotlin
// Act: Play a THREE to make 31 AND complete a run of 4-5-6-3 (reordered: 3-4-5-6)
val cardPlayed = Card(Rank.SIX, Suit.HEARTS) // Another 6 to make exactly 31
```

**Problem:** The comment says "Play a THREE" but the code plays a SIX. The test logic is correct, but the comment is misleading.

**Location:** Line 70

**Fix:** Update comment to match actual card played:
```kotlin
// Act: Play another SIX to make 31 AND create a pair of 6s
val cardPlayed = Card(Rank.SIX, Suit.HEARTS) // Another 6 to make exactly 31
```

### 2. Missing Input Validation (Enhancement)
**File:** `PeggingRoundManager.kt:43-58`
**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Missing precondition check

**Issue:**
The `onPlay` function does not validate that playing the card won't exceed a count of 31.

**Current Code:**
```kotlin
fun onPlay(card: Card): PlayOutcome {
    require(turnOwner() != null) { "Turn owner must be defined" }
    peggingPile += card
    peggingCount += card.getValue()
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Recommendation:**
Add validation to ensure the game state remains valid:
```kotlin
fun onPlay(card: Card): PlayOutcome {
    require(turnOwner() != null) { "Turn owner must be defined" }
    require(peggingCount + card.getValue() <= 31) {
        "Playing ${card} would exceed count limit (current: $peggingCount, card value: ${card.getValue()})"
    }
    peggingPile += card
    peggingCount += card.getValue()
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Justification:** While the UI should prevent invalid moves, defensive programming suggests the state machine should also enforce its invariants. This would catch bugs in the caller and make the contract explicit.

### 3. Code Style Issue (Very Minor)
**File:** `CribbageScorer.kt:283`
**Severity:** Trivial
**Type:** Unnecessarily broad range

**Issue:**
```kotlin
in 4..Int.MAX_VALUE -> { pairPoints = 12; total += 12 }
```

**Problem:** Uses `Int.MAX_VALUE` for a case that can only ever be 4 (since there are only 4 cards of each rank in a standard deck).

**Recommendation:**
```kotlin
else -> { pairPoints = 12; total += 12 } // Four of a kind (max possible)
```
or
```kotlin
4 -> { pairPoints = 12; total += 12 }
```

**Justification:** More precise and easier to understand. The current code is not wrong, just unnecessarily defensive.

## Potential Edge Cases (All Covered by Tests)

✅ Empty pile
✅ Single card pile
✅ Maximum run length (7 cards)
✅ Runs with out-of-order cards
✅ Duplicate cards breaking runs
✅ Multiple scoring opportunities (e.g., 15 + pair, 31 + pair)
✅ Multiple sub-rounds with resets
✅ GO scenarios with and without opponent legal moves
✅ Turn switching after 31 vs after GO
✅ Consecutive GOs from both players
✅ Face card values (J, Q, K = 10)
✅ Ace value (A = 1)
✅ No wrapping runs (K-A-2 is NOT a run)

## Code Quality Observations

### Strengths
1. **Excellent test coverage** - 100+ tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and complex scenarios
2. **Clean separation** - PeggingScorer (pure scoring logic) and PeggingRoundManager (state management) are well separated
3. **Immutable results** - Uses data classes for return values (PeggingPoints, SubRoundReset)
4. **Clear state machine** - PeggingRoundManager has well-defined state transitions
5. **Correct algorithm** - Run detection correctly handles order-independence and duplicate detection

### Architecture
- **PeggingScorer** (lines 257-311 in CribbageScorer.kt): Pure function for scoring a pile
- **PeggingRoundManager** (lines 22-99 in PeggingRoundManager.kt): State machine for turn and round management
- Both classes are testable, maintainable, and follow single-responsibility principle

## Pegging Scoring Logic Deep Dive

### Run Detection Algorithm (Lines 286-300)
```kotlin
for (runLength in pileAfterPlay.size downTo 3) {
    val lastCards = pileAfterPlay.takeLast(runLength)
    val ranks = lastCards.map { it.rank.ordinal }
    val distinctRanks = ranks.toSet().sorted()
    if (distinctRanks.size != runLength) continue // duplicates break pegging runs
    val isConsecutive = distinctRanks.zipWithNext().all { (a, b) -> b - a == 1 }
    if (isConsecutive) {
        runPoints = runLength
        total += runPoints
        break
    }
}
```

**Why This Is Correct:**
1. Checks from longest to shortest (finds maximum run first)
2. Converts to set and sorts (handles out-of-order plays: 5-3-4 becomes 3-4-5)
3. Checks distinct ranks match run length (catches duplicates: 3-4-4-5 has only 3 distinct)
4. Verifies consecutiveness (ensures no gaps: 2-4-5 fails because 2→4 gap)
5. Breaks on first match (only scores longest run, not all sub-runs)

**Test Case Validation:**
- ✅ 5-4-6 correctly scores as run of 3 (PeggingScorerComplexScenariosTest:210-221)
- ✅ 4-5-5-6 correctly scores NO run (PeggingScorerComplexScenariosTest:224-236)
- ✅ 9-6-8-7 correctly scores as run of 4 (PeggingScorerCombosTest:13-24)

### Pair Detection Algorithm (Lines 271-284)
```kotlin
var sameRankCount = 1
val playedCard = pileAfterPlay.lastOrNull()
if (playedCard != null) {
    for (i in pileAfterPlay.size - 2 downTo 0) {
        if (pileAfterPlay[i].rank == playedCard.rank) sameRankCount++ else break
    }
}
```

**Why This Is Correct:**
- Only counts consecutive matching ranks from the tail (K-Q-5-5 scores pair, not K-Q-5-5 all matching)
- Breaks on first non-match (K-K-Q-K only counts the last K-K pair, not all Ks)
- Follows official cribbage pegging rules

## Recommendations

### For This Review
1. ✅ **DO NOT** make any changes - all tests pass and logic is correct
2. ⚠️ **CONSIDER** adding the input validation in Issue #2 as a defensive measure
3. ⚠️ **CONSIDER** fixing the misleading comment in Issue #1 for code clarity
4. ⚠️ **CONSIDER** cleaning up the code style in Issue #3

### For Future Test Coverage
While current coverage is excellent, consider adding tests for:

1. **Boundary testing:** Count values 29, 30, 31 with various cards
2. **Performance testing:** Very long piles (8+ cards) to ensure algorithm scales
3. **Property-based testing:** Use property-based testing library to generate random valid game sequences
4. **Integration testing:** Test PeggingRoundManager + PeggingScorer together in realistic game scenarios

## Plan to Address Pegging Tests

### Current State
✅ All pegging tests pass (100% success rate)
✅ Tests are comprehensive and well-organized
✅ Test names clearly describe scenarios
✅ Tests use descriptive assertions with helpful messages

### Recommended Actions

#### Immediate (Optional)
- [ ] Fix misleading comment in `Pegging31ScoringTest.kt:70`
- [ ] Add input validation to `PeggingRoundManager.onPlay()` as defensive measure

#### Short-term (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add boundary tests for edge count values (29-31 transitions)
- [ ] Add more tests for runs with 6-7 cards in various orders
- [ ] Add integration tests that combine PeggingRoundManager + PeggingScorer

#### Long-term (Enhancement)
- [ ] Consider property-based testing for randomized game sequences
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for large pile sizes
- [ ] Document pegging rules in code comments for future maintainers

### Test Execution Plan
Since all tests currently pass, the execution plan is:

1. **Run full test suite:** `./gradlew test`
2. **Verify pegging tests:** All should pass ✅
3. **If adding new tests:** Run incrementally to ensure no regressions
4. **Maintain coverage:** Ensure new pegging features have corresponding tests

## Conclusion

The pegging game implementation is **CORRECT and WELL-TESTED**. No critical bugs or logic errors were found. The code correctly implements all cribbage pegging rules including:
- Scoring (15s, 31s, pairs, runs)
- Turn management
- GO handling
- Sub-round resets
- Edge cases

The three minor issues identified are **documentation/style improvements** rather than functional bugs. The implementation can be used with confidence.
