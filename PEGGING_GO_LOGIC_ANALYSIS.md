## Official Cribbage GO Rules (Verified)

For reference, here are the official pegging GO rules:

1. **GO Declaration**: When a player cannot play without exceeding 31, they declare "GO"
2. **Opponent Continues**: The opponent plays as many cards as possible without exceeding 31
3. **GO Point Award**: The player who played the LAST CARD before reset scores 1 point for "GO"
4. **31 Special Case**: If a player makes exactly 31, they score 2 points (NOT 3) and NO separate GO point
5. **Reset After GO**: Count resets to 0, and the player who DID NOT play last goes first in next sub-round
6. **Reset After 31**: Same reset rules as GO

## Code Analysis

### File: `PeggingRoundManager.kt`

#### GO Handling Logic (Lines 68-79)
```kotlin
fun onGo(opponentHasLegalMove: Boolean): SubRoundReset? {
    consecutiveGoes += 1

    if (!opponentHasLegalMove) {
        // Immediate reset and GO point (if any last card was played)
        return performReset(resetFor31 = false)
    }

    // Switch turn to opponent and continue; do not reset yet.
    isPlayerTurn = other(isPlayerTurn)
    return null
}
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- Increments GO counter before checking opponent's ability
- Only resets when BOTH players cannot play
- Correctly transfers turn when opponent can still play
- Correctly triggers reset with `resetFor31 = false` for GO scenarios

#### Reset Logic (Lines 81-97)
```kotlin
private fun performReset(resetFor31: Boolean): SubRoundReset {
    val awardTo = if (!resetFor31) lastPlayerWhoPlayed else null

    val last = lastPlayerWhoPlayed
    peggingCount = 0
    peggingPile.clear()
    consecutiveGoes = 0
    isPlayerTurn = if (last == Player.PLAYER) Player.OPPONENT else Player.PLAYER
    lastPlayerWhoPlayed = null

    return SubRoundReset(resetFor31 = resetFor31, goPointTo = awardTo)
}
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- **Line 82**: Awards GO point to `lastPlayerWhoPlayed` when `!resetFor31` (i.e., GO scenario)
- **Line 82**: Awards `null` when `resetFor31 = true` (i.e., 31 scenario - no separate GO point)
- **Line 93**: Next player is opposite of last player (correct per rules)
- **Lines 89-91**: Properly clears state for next sub-round
- **Line 94**: Clears `lastPlayerWhoPlayed` after determining next player

#### Play Logic (Lines 43-61)
```kotlin
fun onPlay(card: Card): PlayOutcome {
    require(turnOwner() != null) { "Turn owner must be defined" }
    require(peggingCount + card.getValue() <= 31) {
        "Playing ${card.rank} would exceed count limit (current: $peggingCount, card value: ${card.getValue()})"
    }
    peggingPile += card
    peggingCount += card.getValue()
    lastPlayerWhoPlayed = isPlayerTurn
    consecutiveGoes = 0

    if (peggingCount == 31) {
        val reset = performReset(resetFor31 = true)
        return PlayOutcome(reset = reset)
    }

    isPlayerTurn = other(isPlayerTurn)
    return PlayOutcome(reset = null)
}
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- **Lines 45-47**: ✅ INPUT VALIDATION PRESENT - Validates card won't exceed 31
- **Line 50**: Updates `lastPlayerWhoPlayed` before checking for 31
- **Line 51**: Resets `consecutiveGoes` on any play (correct behavior)
- **Lines 53-56**: Correctly triggers 31 reset with `resetFor31 = true`
- **Line 59**: Switches turn after normal play (not after 31 - turn switch happens in reset)

---

## Edge Case Analysis

### Edge Case 1: No Cards Played, Both Players GO
**Scenario:**
- Initial state: `peggingCount = 0`, `lastPlayerWhoPlayed = null`
- Both players immediately say GO

**Expected Behavior:**
- No GO point awarded (no last player)
- Count resets to 0 (already 0)
- Default player goes first

**Code Behavior:**
```kotlin
val awardTo = if (!resetFor31) lastPlayerWhoPlayed else null
// awardTo = null (correct, no last player)

isPlayerTurn = if (last == Player.PLAYER) Player.OPPONENT else Player.PLAYER
// When last = null, this evaluates to: Player.PLAYER
```

**Result:** ✅ CORRECT - No GO point, PLAYER goes first (reasonable default)

**Test Coverage:** `PeggingRoundManagerEdgeCasesTest::onGo_afterNoPlays_noGoPointAwarded` (line 154-162)

### Edge Case 2: Player Reaches 31 After Opponent Said GO
**Scenario:**
1. Count at 25, PLAYER says GO (can't play without exceeding)
2. OPPONENT plays a 6 to reach exactly 31

**Expected Behavior:**
- OPPONENT scores 2 points for 31 (NO separate GO point)
- Count resets
- PLAYER goes first in next sub-round

**Code Behavior:**
```kotlin
// Step 1: onGo(opponentHasLegalMove = true)
consecutiveGoes += 1  // = 1
isPlayerTurn = other(isPlayerTurn)  // switches to OPPONENT
return null  // no reset yet

// Step 2: onPlay(6-value card)
peggingCount = 31
lastPlayerWhoPlayed = OPPONENT
consecutiveGoes = 0  // reset on play
performReset(resetFor31 = true)
// awardTo = null (correct, no GO point for 31)
// isPlayerTurn = PLAYER (opposite of OPPONENT)
```

**Result:** ✅ CORRECT - OPPONENT gets 2 for 31, PLAYER goes first, no GO point

**Test Coverage:** `PeggingRoundManagerMultipleGoTest::play31_resetsImmediately_noGoPoint` (line 78-103)

### Edge Case 3: Multiple Consecutive GOs
**Scenario:**
1. PLAYER plays card
2. OPPONENT plays card (now OPPONENT is last)
3. PLAYER says GO (opponent can play)
4. OPPONENT plays another card (now OPPONENT is last again)
5. PLAYER says GO (opponent cannot play) → triggers reset

**Expected Behavior:**
- OPPONENT gets GO point (was last to play)
- PLAYER goes first in next sub-round

**Code Behavior:**
```kotlin
// After step 4: lastPlayerWhoPlayed = OPPONENT
// Step 5:
performReset(resetFor31 = false)
awardTo = lastPlayerWhoPlayed = OPPONENT  // correct
isPlayerTurn = PLAYER  // opposite of OPPONENT, correct
```

**Result:** ✅ CORRECT

**Test Coverage:** `PeggingRoundManagerTest::consecutiveGoesAcrossTurns_triggersResetAndAwards` (line 54-79)

### Edge Case 4: Hitting Exactly 31 With Multiple Scoring
**Scenario:**
- Pile: K(10), Q(10), 5, 6 (pair of 6s)
- Count = 31

**Expected Behavior:**
- Score 2 for 31
- Score 2 for pair of 6s
- Total = 4 points
- NO separate GO point

**Code Behavior:**
```kotlin
// PeggingScorer.pointsForPile handles scoring
// PeggingRoundManager handles GO point
// When peggingCount == 31:
performReset(resetFor31 = true)
// awardTo = null (correct)
```

**Result:** ✅ CORRECT - Scoring is separate from GO point logic

**Test Coverage:** `Pegging31ScoringTest::testHitting31_withMultipleScoringOpportunities` (line 39-58)

- ✅ Turn switching after each play
- ✅ Turn switching after GO reset
- ✅ Turn switching after 31 reset
- ✅ Pile maintenance and clearing
- ✅ Count tracking and resetting

#### GO Handling Tests
