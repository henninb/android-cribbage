---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. PerimeterX SDK Usage (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Issue**: The app includes PerimeterX SDK (com.perimeterx.sdk:msdk:3.4.0), a security/fraud prevention SDK.

**Concerns**:
- PerimeterX is designed for apps that need bot/fraud protection
- Typically used by apps with user accounts, payments, or high-value transactions
- For an offline card game, this SDK appears **unnecessary**
- Adds ~1-2MB to app size and collects device/usage data
- May trigger additional scrutiny during Play Store review

**Location**:
- `app/build.gradle:61` - Dependency declaration
- `CribbageApplication.kt:15-28` - SDK initialization
- `AndroidManifest.xml:5-6` - Permissions required by SDK

**Recommendation**:
```
OPTION 1 (Recommended): Remove PerimeterX SDK
- Remove dependency from build.gradle
- Remove initialization from CribbageApplication.kt
- Update privacy policy to remove PerimeterX disclosure
- May be able to remove INTERNET permission if no other network use

OPTION 2: Keep with justification
- If you plan to add online features (multiplayer, leaderboards)
- Document the justification in Play Store description
- Ensure privacy policy clearly explains data collection
```

**Impact if not addressed**:
- May delay approval process
- Reviewers may request justification
- User concerns about unnecessary data collection

---

### 2. Debug Logging in Production Code (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Production code contains debug logging statements.

**Findings**:
- 37 occurrences of `Log.d()`, `Log.i()`, etc. across 4 files
- 2 occurrences of `println()` statements
- Debug logs can leak sensitive information
- Minor performance impact

**Affected Files**:
- `CribbageApplication.kt` (8 Log + 1 println)
- `MainActivity.kt` (4 Log)
- `CribbageMainScreen.kt` (24 Log)
- `UserAgentInterceptor.kt` (1 Log + 1 println)

**Recommendation**:
```kotlin
// OPTION 1: Remove debug logs (Log.d, Log.i)
// Keep only Log.w and Log.e for important warnings/errors

// OPTION 2: Use BuildConfig check
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Debug message")
}

// OPTION 3: Enable ProGuard log removal (already configured)
// Uncomment in proguard-rules.pro:151-155
```

**Impact if not addressed**:
- Minor security concern (info disclosure)
- Minimal performance impact
- Not a blocker for approval

---

### 3. Unused Network Code (PRIORITY: LOW)

**Issue**: Unused Retrofit/OkHttp service interfaces present.

**Findings**:
- `LoginService.kt` - Retrofit interface (not used)
- `ScheduleService.kt` - Retrofit interface (not used)
- `UserAgentInterceptor.kt` - OkHttp interceptor (only used by PerimeterX)

**Recommendation**:
```bash
# Remove unused files (reduces confusion)
rm app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/LoginService.kt
rm app/src/main/java/com/brianhenning/cribbage/ScheduleService.kt
# UserAgentInterceptor only needed if keeping PerimeterX
```

**Impact if not addressed**:
- No functional impact
- Minor code cleanliness issue
- Not a blocker for approval

---

### 4. Privacy Policy Hosting (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Issue**: Privacy policy created but not yet hosted publicly.

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Policy created (PRIVACY_POLICY.md, docs/privacy-policy.md)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet committed to git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Pages not yet enabled

**Action Required**:
1. Commit privacy policy files to git
2. Push to GitHub
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: docs folder)
4. Verify URL works: https://henninb.github.io/android-cribbage/privacy-policy
5. Use this URL in Play Store listing

**Impact if not addressed**:
- **BLOCKER** - Cannot submit without hosted privacy policy URL
- Play Store requires publicly accessible privacy policy

## üìã Play Store Data Safety Section

When filling out the Data Safety section in Play Console:

### Data Collection
**Question**: Does your app collect or share user data?
**Answer**: YES (if keeping PerimeterX) / NO (if removed)

### If YES (PerimeterX SDK present):

**Data Types Collected**:
- ‚úÖ Device or other IDs (by PerimeterX)
- ‚úÖ App interactions (by PerimeterX)
- ‚úÖ Crash logs (by PerimeterX)

**Data Usage**:
- ‚úÖ Fraud prevention, security, and compliance

**Data Sharing**:
- ‚úÖ Data shared with PerimeterX (now Human Security)

**Data Security**:
- ‚úÖ Data is encrypted in transit
- ‚úÖ Data is encrypted at rest
- ‚ùå Users cannot request deletion (handled by PerimeterX)

### If NO (PerimeterX removed):

**Data Types Collected**:
- Only local game statistics (not transmitted)

**All questions**: NO

This is the ideal scenario for a simple offline game.
