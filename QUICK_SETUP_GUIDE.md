# Quick Setup Guide - Secure App Signing

## ‚úÖ What You've Already Done
- [x] Created keystore: `~/.android/keystores/cribbage-release-key.jks`
- [x] Paid $25 Play Store developer fee
- [x] Created custom cribbage app icon

## üîê Step 1: Set Up Secure Environment Variables

Run this script to set up your passwords securely:

```fish
./setup_fish_secrets.fish
```

**What this does**:
- Creates `~/.config/fish/secrets.fish` with your passwords (NOT in git)
- Updates `~/.config/fish/config.fish` with safe config (OK to commit)
- Adds `secrets.fish` to `.gitignore`
- Sets file permissions to 600

**Then reload your Fish config**:
```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

### Verify Setup
```fish
for var in CRIBBAGE_KEYSTORE_PATH CRIBBAGE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD CRIBBAGE_KEY_ALIAS CRIBBAGE_KEY_PASSWORD
    if set -q $var
        echo "‚úÖ $var is set"
    else
        echo "‚ùå $var is NOT set"
    end
end
```

## üîß Step 2: Update build.gradle

Add this signing configuration to `app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    // ... existing config ...

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file(System.getenv("CRIBBAGE_KEYSTORE_PATH") ?: "${System.properties['user.home']}/.android/keystores/cribbage-release-key.jks")
            storePassword System.getenv("CRIBBAGE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
            keyAlias System.getenv("CRIBBAGE_KEY_ALIAS") ?: "cribbage-release"
            keyPassword System.getenv("CRIBBAGE_KEY_PASSWORD")
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled = true  // Enable code shrinking
            shrinkResources = true  // Remove unused resources
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```
